    "Sensors are noisy. The world is full of data and events that we want to measure and track, but we cannot rely on sensors to give us perfect information. I have a mechanical scale at home; if I weigh the same object multiple times I often get slightly different readings. \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple cases the solution is obvious. If my scale gives slightly different readings I can just take a few readings and average them. Or I can replace it with a more accurate scale. But what do we do when the sensor is very noisy, or the environment makes data collection difficult? We may be trying to track the movement of a low flying aircraft. We may want to create an autopilot for a drone, or ensure that our farm tractor seeded the entire field. I do computer vision, and I need to track moving objects in images, and the computer vision algorithms create very noisy and unreliable results. \n",
    "\n",
    "This book teaches you how to solve these sorts of filtering problems. I use many different algorithms, but they are all based on **Bayesian probability**. In simple terms Bayesian probability determines what is likely to be true based on past information. For example, suppose you drive home late and see a masked person breaking the window of your neighbors house. You'd conclude that they are a burglar. But you know what your neighbor looks like, and despite the mask this person looks like him. You connot be sure, but your certainty that this is a crime lessens. Now suppose that you remember that this is October 31 - Halloween in the US, when we dress up in costumes. This provides a reason for the mask, and you form the hypothesis that your neighbor locked himself out. Finally,  your wife interjects \"didn't they sell that house last week? Why is he trying to get inside\". This new piece of information favors the crime hypothesis, and you call the police.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is more to Bayesian probability, but you have the main idea. Knowledge is uncertain, and we alter our beliefs based on the strength of the evidence. How does this apply to filtering? Say we are trying to track an aircraft that up to now has been flying straight and level. A sensor reports that it suddenly changed direction. Did it really turn, or is the data noisy? It depends. If this is a jet fighter we may be very inclined to believe the report of a sudden maneuver. If it is a large, cumbersome passenger jet we might be very skeptical. If the sensor is extremely accurate then we would tend to believe it. Our beliefs depend on the past and on our knowledge of the system we are tracking."

    "## Motivation for this Book\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kalman filter was invented by Rudolf Emil Kálmán to solve this sort of problem in a mathematically optimal way. The theory and applications are beautiful, but quite difficult to learn if you are not already well trained in topics such as signal processing, control theory, probability and statistics, and guidance and control theory. Its first use was on the Apollo missions to the moon, and since then it has been used in an enormous variety of domains. There are Kalman filters in aircraft, on submarines, on cruise missiles. Wall street uses them to track the market. They are used in robots, in IoT (Internet of Things) sensors, and in laboratory instruments. Chemical plants use them to control and monitor reactions. They are used in medical equipment to do things like medical imaging or to remove noise from cardiac signals. If it involves a sensor, a Kalman filter or a close relative to the Kalman filter is usually involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm a software engineer that spent almost two decades in aerospace, and so I have always been 'bumping elbows' with the Kalman filter, but never implemented one. They always had a fearsome reputation for difficulty, and I did not have the requisite education. Everyone I met that did implement them had multiple graduate courses on the topic and extensive industrial experience with them. As I moved into solving tracking problems with computer vision the need to implement them myself became urgent. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are classic textbooks in the field, such as Grewal and Andrew's *Kalman Filtering*. But sitting down and trying to read many of these books is a dismal and trying experience if you do not have the necessary background. Typically the first few chapters fly through several years of undergraduate math, blithely referring you to textbooks on Itō calculus, and presenting an entire semester's worth of statistics in a few brief paragraphs. These books are good textbooks for an upper undergraduate  or graduate level course, and an invaluable reference to researchers and professionals, but the going is truly difficult for the more casual reader. Notation is introduced without explanation, different texts use different words and variables names for the same concept, and the books are almost devoid of examples or worked problems. I often found myself able to parse the words and comprehend the mathematics of a definition, but had no idea as to what real world phenomena these words and math were attempting to describe. \"But what does that *mean?*\" was my repeated thought. Here are typical examples which once puzzled me:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{x}_{k} = \\Phi_{k}\\hat{x}_{k-1} + G_ku_{k-1} + K_k[z_k - H\\Phi_{k}\\hat{x}_{k-1} - HG_ku_{k-1} ] \\\\\n",
    "\\mathbf{P}_{k\\mid k} = (I - \\mathbf{K}_k \\mathbf{H}_{k})\\textrm{cov}(\\mathbf{x}_k - \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{k\\mid k-1})(I - \\mathbf{K}_k \\mathbf{H}_{k})^{\\text{T}}  + \\mathbf{K}_k\\textrm{cov}(\\mathbf{v}_k )\\mathbf{K}_k^{\\text{T}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as I began to finally understand the Kalman filter I realized the underlying concepts are quite straightforward. A few simple probability rules, some intuition about how we integrate disparate knowledge to explain events and the core concepts of the Kalman filter are accessible. Kalman filters have a reputation for difficulty, but shorn of much of the formal terminology the beauty of the subject and of their math became clear to me, and I fell in love with the topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "As I began to understand the math and theory more difficulties appeared. A book or paper will make some statement of fact and presents a graph as proof.  Unfortunately, why the statement is true is not clear to me, and I didn't understand how to create the plot. Or maybe I wonder \"is this true if R=0?\"  Or the author provides pseudocode at such a high level that the implementation is not obvious. Some books offer Matlab code, but I do not have a license to that expensive package. Finally, many books end each chapter with many useful exercises. Exercises which you need to understand if you want to implement Kalman filters for yourself, but exercises with no answers. If you are using the book in a classroom, perhaps this is okay, but it is terrible for the independent reader. I loathe that an author withholds information from me, presumably to avoid 'cheating' by the student in the classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this impedes learning, from my point of view. Certainly if you are designing a Kalman filter for a aircraft or missile you must thoroughly master of all of the mathematics and topics in a typical Kalman filter textbook. I just want to track an image on a screen, or write some code for my Arduino project. I want to know how the plots in the book are made, and chose different parameters than the author chose. I want to run simulations. I want to inject more noise in the signal and see how a filter performs. There are thousands of opportunities for using Kalman filters in everyday code, and yet this fairly straightforward topic is the provenance of rocket scientists and academics.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote this book to address all of those needs. This is not the book for you if you design radars for Raytheon. Go get a Masters or PhD at Georgia Tech, UW, or the like, because you'll need it. This book is for the hobbyist, the curious, and the working engineer that needs to filter or smooth data. \n",
    "\n",
    "This book is interactive. While you can read it online as static content, I urge you to use it as intended. It is written using Jupyter Notebook (formally known as IPython Notebook). This allows me to combine text, math, Python, and Python output in one place. Every plot, every piece of data in this book is generated from Python inside the notebook.

    "Most Kalman filtering and other engineering texts are written by mathematicians or academics. When there is software(rarely) , it is not production quality. I will take Paul Zarchan's book *Fundamentals of Kalman Filtering* as an example. This is a fantastic book and it belongs in your library, and is one of the few books that provides full source for every example and chart. But the code is Fortran without any subroutines beyond calls to functions like `MATMUL`. Kalman filters are re-implemented throughout the book. The same listing mixes simulation with filtering code, making it hard to distinguish them. Some chapters implement the same filter in subtly different ways, and uses bold text to highlight the few lines that changed. If Runge Kutta is needed it is embedded in the code, without comments. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's a better way. If I want to perform Runge Kutta I call `ode45`, I do not embed an Runge Kutta implementation in my code. I don't want to implement Runge Kutta multiple times and debug it several times. if I do find a bug, I can fix it once and be assured that it now works across all my different projects. And, it is readable. It is rare that I care about the implementation of Runge Kutta.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a textbook on Kalman filtering, and you can argue that we *do* care about the implementation of Kalman filters. That is true, but you will find out the code that performs the filtering amounts to 10 or so lines of code. The code to implement the math is fairly trivial. Most of the work that Kalman filter requires is the design of the matrices that get fed into the math engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible downside is that the equations that perform the filtering are hidden behind functions, which we could argue is a loss in a pedagogical text. I argue the converse. I want you to learn how to use Kalman filters in the real world, for real projects, and you shouldn't be cutting and pasting established algorithms all over the place.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use Python classes. I mostly use classes as a way to organize the data that the filters require, not to implement OO features such as inheritence. For example, the `KalmanFilter` class stores matrices called `x`, `P`, `R`, `Q`. I've seen procedural libraries for Kalman filters, and they require the programmer to maintain all of those matrices. This perhaps isn't so bad for a toy program, but program a bank of Kalman filters and you will not enjoy having to manage all of those matrices and other associated data. I have derived from these classes occasionaly in my own work, and find it handy, but I don't want to force OO on people as I know many do not like it."
